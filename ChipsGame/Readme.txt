This folder contains java and python classes. The java version is one that I wrote in school
The Python version is one that I wrote to try to learn python better. Chips is a game of 
takeaway, the premis is that there is a pile of arbitrary size of chips and each player takes
a turn in taking away a certain amount of chips, players are allowed to take at least 1, and 
at most 1 - entire pile on the first turn. Then the max move becomes double the last players
move. The player that takes away the last chip(s) wins. It is best played with two players We 
had an in class competition and the program called Jack Player was the winning strategy of the 
class and it was a very simple strategy. I basically did this project to learn Python though
but I figured I'd post it as well just as a reference point for seeing how objects interact
in Python.
