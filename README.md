# Projects
These folders are some of the main things I have been working on,DiviDatesAnomalyInfo
and FinancialProject pertain to going online and gettting financial information and 
putting it into excel or a database. ChipsGame was originally a lab that I had in
school that was written in java. I later ported most of it to python, I did not go
as in depth with the python version as the java one as the python one was mostly for
learning how to use the language in an object oriented way.
