This whole project here was about looking for information for something called the ex-dividend anomaly.
The program here takes info from online and puts it into an excel file, it was supposed to help the 
finance majors in our algorithmic trading club to see the numbers as well. The ex-dividend anomaly is 
this thing where the market makers correct the price of a stock when it pays a dividend after the ex
date, but the price never drops the full value of the dividend, so in theory one could just buy the
stock at 3:59 one day and then sell it at 9:30 the next day. The theory is that you will lose money on
those trades but you will have a positive return as the dividend will make up the loss. This project
was a way to look at some metrics and see if we could develop a way to pick the stocks that had the 
highest chance of covering all of the way so that more money could be made. This is set up for my
computer though so the filepaths have to be set right on others computers. The output of this program
should be a bunch of excel files all with stock information for stocks that are declaring ex-dividend
on the data specified by the file.
